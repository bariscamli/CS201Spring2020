# CS201 - Data Structures and Algorithms

<h4>In this lecture, I roughly implemented various sorting algorithms for each homework except hw_2 and hw_5.</h4>

<h4>Descriptions PDF's of the homeworks are inside in their own folder.</h4>


- Homework 1 contains the Insertion Sort implementation.

- Homework 2 contains the Stack implementation.

- Homework 3 contains the Heap Sort implementation.

- Homework 4 contains the Quicksort implementation (slightly better than regular Quicksort with small trick).

- Homework 5 contains conduction an experiment with the programs that I have written for Homework 1, 3, and 4.
